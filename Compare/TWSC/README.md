Data
------------
Please download the data from corresponding addresses.
1. cleanimages: 20 high quality commonly used natural gray scale images

2. nc: real noisy images with no ''ground truth''
                        This dataset can be found at http://demo.ipol.im/demo/125/
3. cc: 15 cropped real noisy images from CC [1]. 
                        This dataset can be found at  http://snam.ml/research/ccnoise
                        The smaller 15 cropped images can be found on in the directory

                                                The *real.png are noisy images;
                                                The *mean.png are "ground truth" images;
                                                The *ours.png are images denoised by CC.
4. dnd: The Darmstadt Noise Dataset [2] consists of 50 pairs of real noisy images, 
             each images provides 50 crops, resulting overall 1,000 crops provided on
